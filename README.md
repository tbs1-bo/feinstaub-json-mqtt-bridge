Installation
------------

Ansible can be used to install this tool as a service.

    $ ansible-playbook -K playbook-deploy.yml
    
The tool will be installed as daemontools service. Option ``-K`` asks for the 
sudo-Passwort - only needed if daemontools must be installed.

To test the service you can now post a sample request found in the
repo.

    curl -d @sample_post.txt -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:8080/feinstaub/json2mqtt

daemontools services
--------------------

The folder ``services`` contains services controlled by the 
[daemontools](https://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) 
([german documentation](https://wiki.uberspace.de/system:daemontools)).
Navigate into this folder and run ``svscan``. After this the json2mqtt-Service
is launched and it is connected to a logging service afterwards. Logs are placed in 
``json2mqtt/log/main``.
